# ðŸš— Lane Detection + Vehicle Detection using YOLOv11

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses **YOLOv11** for:
- **Lane Segmentation** â†’ To identify drivable area and lane boundaries.
- **Vehicle Detection** â†’ To detect vehicles ahead.
- **Distance Measurement** â†’ Using camera parameters for Forward Collision Avoidance (FCA).
- **Collision Warning** â†’ Alerts when a vehicle is too close.


## ðŸ›  Features
- Real-time lane and vehicle detection
- Lane overlay highlighting drivable path
- Distance calculation using pinhole camera model
- Forward collision warning based on threshold distance
